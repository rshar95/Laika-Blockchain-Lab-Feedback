As a developer interacting with Laika Blockchain Lab for the first time, I have to say I am impressed how intuitive and easy to learn the interface is. 
It took some time to understand read/write mode and setting up the connection with MetaMask. But overall, the user interface is easily accessible. 

Issues/Bugs: 

When calling the register, however the instructions were clear the request was taking forever. I later figured out it required Eth gas fees to process and Meta Mask extension in my browser wasnâ€™t showing any pop ups or reports. But I later figured it out and then it became easily accessible.

Final Thoughts:

I very much enjoyed the functionality provided by Laika Blockchain Lab and how easy it makes creating smart contracts.
